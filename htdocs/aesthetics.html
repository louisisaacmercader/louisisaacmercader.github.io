        <h2>Patterns Part 1</h2>
        <p>Placing your objects with consistent gaps is something that can be observed in many modern maps. This is called <span class="bold">visual spacing</span>. An efficient way to make use of visual spacing is to set up your objects in a grid. The famous hexgrid pattern (circles formed along triangles) popularized by mappers like Lust and Monstrata can be seen in a lot of mappers' styles. Don't be afraid to overlap and copy & paste.<br> <br>
        Other than looking aesthetically pleasing, visual spacing can also be used as a form of musical emphasis. In stronger sections of the song, you can use greater or smaller spacing to emphasize its intensity and/or calmness. Generally, you would expect a power metal song's chorus to have objects that are far to each other and a peaceful piano ballad to have closer objects. You can also use this to break the player's expectations through drastic changes in spaacing when the music calls for it. <br> <br>

            <h2>Patterns Part 2</h2>
            <p>The use of <span class="bold">reflection</span> (ctrl+h for vertical, ctrl+j for horizontal) and <span class="bold">rotation</span> (< and > for 90 degrees, ctrl+shift+r for specific values) is very useful for making your objects look nicer as symmetry in any form is typically satisfying to look at. You will be using these two techniques a lot so it's important to get used to their shortcuts. They make your object placement feel more diliberate instead of random and you always want to avoid making your patterns random.

            <h2>Patterns Part 3</h2>
            <p>When creating sliders, it's useful to keep in mind the possible patterns you can make with surrounding objects. A common method of doing this is through wrapping it around other circles or sliders. This is known as a <span class="bold">blanket</span>. Using blankets can make your map look much more organized and clean. However, it is important that you do not overuse blankets as they can lead to making your map look boring and lazy. <br> <br>
            The easiest way to make a good circular blanket is by first placing a circle and a basic slider. After that, adjust the slider's anchors with your cursor and make its slider body follow an approach circle.

            <h2>Fancy Slider Shapes and Representing Music through Visuals</h2>
            <p>Aside from the three basic slider shapes shown in the editor section of this guide, there are plenty of slightly more advanced shaped you can create. These three are some of the most common sliders used in a lot of maps. <br> <br>
            The first one is made using two end points and one off-centered <span class="red">red</span> anchor placed in the middle. The second one, also known as a wave slider, is created using four or more <span class="gray">gray</span> anchors placed in a Z formation. The last one is made with straight parallel ends and two middle <span class="red">red</span> anchors slightly spaced apart. <br> <br>
            For even more complex slider shapes like those found in most tech maps or parts in music with prolonged held sounds, just keep in mind not to just spam anchors and try to remember the concept of visual spacing. <br> <br> <br>

            <img src="../images/page3_messy.png" alt="messy aesthetics" height="171" class="imgright"> <br>
            Sometimes it can be better to intentionally make everything messy when the music calls for it. A good example of this is Monstrata's A-L-I-E-N. It uses chaotic sliders and object placement in the very disorganized metal section of the song and typical clean mapping in the calm rock section.
